# PureRide

PureRide is a ride-sharing mobile application created from Genesys interal hackathon. The idea stems from being unable to grab food outside the company as a coop who does not own a vehicle. As the team is comprised with mostly coops, we quickly resonate with the idea and want to create an application to connect coop with full-time employees who regularily go out for lunch. This application can extend its usage to organizing ride-sharing for other company's event in additional to lunches!
